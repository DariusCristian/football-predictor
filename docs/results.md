# Backtest Results

## 2026-10-03 — Baseline comparison

Walk-forward from 2023-08-01, retraining weekly, training only on
matches completed strictly before each prediction date.

| model          |    n | log loss | Brier |
|----------------|------|----------|-------|
| poisson        | 1184 |    1.027 | 0.594 |
| league average | 1190 |    1.076 | 0.651 |
| always home    | 1190 |    1.757 | 0.986 |

**Finding:** the Poisson model beats the league-average baseline by
~4.5% in log loss. Team identity carries real but modest signal;
football outcomes are dominated by variance.

**Caveat:** poisson n is 6 lower — matches involving teams absent from
the training data are skipped, so the comparison is not over an
identical set.
